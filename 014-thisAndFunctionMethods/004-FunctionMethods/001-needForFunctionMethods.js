/*

Function methods:
    - call()
    - apply()
    - bind()

Need:
    These methods let us manually set the value of 'this' inside a function â€” especially useful when:

        - we are using a function outside its original object

        - we want to reuse a method from one object with another.

        - we want to control execution context (i.e., what this refers to).
