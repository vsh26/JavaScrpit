# Events

- Events are actions that happen in the browser â€” like a user clicking a button, typing in a field, or resizing the window.
- With JavaScript, we can listen for these events and respond accordingly.

## Types of events

| **Event Type** | **Triggered When...**                | **Used On**             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |

| `dblclick`     | Double-clicked                       | Same as above           |
| `mouseover`    | Mouse enters the element area        | Menus, tooltips         |

## Event object

- Whenever an event occurs (like a click, keypress, submit), JavaScript gives us an event object that contains details about what happened, where, and how.
- You access it via the parameter in your callback function.

| **Property/Method**       | **Description**                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event.type`              | Type of the event (`click`, `keydown`, etc.)            |
| `event.target`            | Element **where the event actually happened**           |
| `event.currentTarget`     | Element **the listener is attached to**                 |
| `event.preventDefault()`  | Stops default behavior (form submit, link follow, etc.) |
| `event.stopPropagation()` | Prevents the event from bubbling to parent elements     |
| `event.key`               | Key pressed during keyboard event (`a`, `Enter`, etc.)  |
| `event.code`              | Physical key location (`KeyA`, `ArrowUp`, etc.)         |
| `event.clientX/Y`         | Mouse position (X, Y) in **viewport**                   |
| `event.pageX/Y`           | Mouse position relative to **document**                 |
| `event.which`             | Deprecated, use `key` instead (for legacy support)      |
